# Student Dashboard Testing Guide

## Overview
The Student Dashboard is now ready for testing! It has been converted from React Native components to proper web components and includes all necessary styling and functionality.

## What's Fixed
✅ **React Native Components**: Converted to proper web components (div, button, input, etc.)
✅ **Styling**: Modern, responsive CSS with proper web styling
✅ **API Integration**: Configurable API base URL with environment variables
✅ **Modals**: Complete profile and registry management modals
✅ **Error Handling**: Proper loading states and error messages
✅ **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly layout

## How to Test

### 1. Start the Development Server
```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

### 2. Access the Dashboard
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
2. You should see the landing page
3. Click "Sign In" or "Sign Up" as a student
4. You'll be redirected to the Student Dashboard

### 3. Test Dashboard Features

#### Basic Functionality
- [ ] Dashboard loads without errors
- [ ] Header displays user information
- [ ] Stats cards show progress information
- [ ] Action buttons are clickable
- [ ] Recent activity section displays registry items

#### Profile Management
- [ ] Click "Edit Profile" button
- [ ] Modal opens with current profile data
- [ ] Form fields are editable
- [ ] Save changes works (if backend is running)
- [ ] Modal closes properly

#### Registry Management
- [ ] Click "Manage Registry" button
- [ ] Modal opens with registry form
- [ ] Can add new registry items
- [ ] Current items are displayed
- [ ] Form validation works

#### Responsive Design
- [ ] Dashboard looks good on desktop
- [ ] Dashboard adapts to mobile screen sizes
- [ ] Modals work properly on mobile

### 4. Browser Console Testing
Open the browser console and run:
```javascript
testDashboard()
```

This will run automated tests and show results in the console.

## API Configuration
The dashboard is configured to connect to `http://localhost:3001` by default. To change this:

1. Create a `.env` file in the frontend directory
2. Add: `REACT_APP_API_URL=your_api_url`
3. Restart the development server

## Known Issues
- The dashboard currently uses simulated authentication (localStorage)
- API calls will fail if the backend is not running
- Some features require backend endpoints to be implemented

## Next Steps
1. Start the backend server
2. Implement missing API endpoints
3. Replace simulated auth with real authentication
4. Add more comprehensive error handling
5. Implement real-time updates

## File Structure
```
frontend/src/components/
├── StudentDashboard.tsx    # Main dashboard component
├── StudentDashboard.css    # Dashboard styling
└── test-dashboard.js       # Testing utilities
```
