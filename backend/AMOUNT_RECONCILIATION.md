- String amounts in database
- Invalid amounts (negative or NaN)
- API/database mismatches
- Currency formatting errors

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **String Amounts in Database**
   - Run database migration to convert to numbers
   - Check data import processes

2. **API/Database Mismatches**
   - Verify date filtering logic
   - Check status filtering
   - Ensure proper number conversion

3. **Currency Formatting Issues**
   - Verify Intl.NumberFormat usage
   - Check locale settings
   - Test edge cases (zero, large numbers)

### Running Scripts

Make sure the backend server is running:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Then run the checks:
```bash
# Quick check
npm run amounts:check

# Full reconciliation
npm run amounts:reconcile
```

## Data Integrity

These scripts help ensure:
- All amounts are stored as numbers
- API responses are consistent
- Currency formatting is correct
- No data corruption exists

Run these regularly to maintain data integrity and catch issues early!
